# SnowMon

A simple demo of a snowy forest which indicates current RAM usage with the intensity of a snowstorm.

Built upon an **entirely self-made HTTP server from scratch**, using **no third-party libraries**.

## Build and run

```shell
cd winter/
javac -d out src/**/*.java  # compile
java -cp out Main # run
```

Then, open in a browser (port 8000 by default):

```shell
xdg-open http://localhost:8000
```
