# TicketChief

## Build and run

Hi, marker! To hopefully save you a bit of a hassle, here's how to build and run the code in this submission:

```shell
cd part1/  # or part2/, or part3/
javac -d out src/**/*.java  # compile
java -cp out TicketChief # run
```

Then, open in a browser (port 8000 by default):

```shell
xdg-open http://localhost:8000
```
